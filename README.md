Custom wakeword detection by turtle.ai

This is a project by Max, Sina, and Chris!

Our project focused on finding a functional zero-shot solution to custom wake word detection for use in things like virtual assistants and accessibility software. We proved that it is very much possible to build that solution, and that a well optimized and refined pipeline is within reach with current open source technology!

All that to say: Our pipeline allowed you to set and detect any English language wakeword and was fairly robust to accented English - as well as having moderate success with non-English words (up to and including non-word vocalizations)

Work still needs to be done, again, to refine and make the pipeline more inclusive and more robust to non-English wake words, but it's a great jumping off point!
